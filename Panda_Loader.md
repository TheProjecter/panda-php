# Introduction #

`Panda_Loader` is a utility class for dynamically loading dependencies in PHP applications. `Panda_Loader` supports [faux namespaces](faux_namespaces.md), class name generation (from paths) and file name generation (from class names). Libraries may be loaded on-the-fly and class instances may be generated immediately upon loading.
