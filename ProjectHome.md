# Introduction #

Panda PHP is a powerful set of useful PHP components to make everyday PHP development easier.

Although Panda PHP isn't a framework itself, a simple MVC-style [framework](Panda_Framework.md) has be written using Panda PHP, and is included with the source distribution.

# Core Values #
Everything in Panda PHP is an object. In order to use Panda PHP to its fullest, you should be familiar with object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, and typehinting.

An understanding of common patterns such as [ActiveRecord](ActiveRecord_pattern.md), [Model-View-Controller](Model_View_Controller_pattern.md), [Command](Command_pattern.md), [Singleton](Singleton_pattern.md), and [Factory](Factory_pattern.md) will help you considerably as you work with Panda PHP.

Panda PHP makes heavy use of PHP 5 interceptors and [SPL](http://php.net/spl) therefore the is no hope for a backport to PHP 4. This is a good thing.
