= 1.0 Package Requirements =

The driving goal behind the 1.0 release will be to provide the necessary components to develop a flexible framework to handle various page load scenarios. 

==Model-View-Controller==

A MVC approach has been chosen because of it's exceptional scalability. 

===Models===

Models represent data within an application. 

===Views===

Views handle the presentation of data within an application.

===Controllers===

Controllers act as a broker between views and models. Controllers receive requests to view or manipulate data and communicate appropriately to a model and then pass the result to the view.
